title: About Me
---

I'm a software engineer in Sydney Australia with a passion for delivering great experiences for developers and end users.

After graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering (Hons.), I found my passion in the software industry streamlining the data collection and enrichment process for a sports statistics startup.

Since then I've worked on CMS and CRM platforms, a range of developer tooling solutions to improve the developer experience, greenfield redevelopments focusing on performance, and Universal Rendering for dynamic builds of components to integrate with non-V8 templating systems.
