      This is how I often feel trying to verify program behaviour working as a web developer in a dynamic-typed language. Writing correct software is hard. And it's especially hard with most of the web stacks that are popular at present.

      <br /><br />Today I'm going to speak about developer experience, specifically where it can be improved by using a language like Reason. This is a talk about how to improve the quality of the software you create, improving the reliability of your product, improving the day to day experience of your working life.

      How many functions do you think you can write that implement that type signature? What you see here is the "type signature" of a function, yet unnamed, that will take a value of a certain type, represented by the "type variable" (aka. "generic" or "template") "a" and must return a value of that same type.

      <br /><br />The function has no other information about the possible inputs and outputs than that, meaning it can operate on literally any possible type.

      <br /><br />That's a wide breadth of applicability. So how many functions do you think you can write that obey this signature?

      The absolute freedom granted by the types also absolutely restricts the implementation. Because we don't restrict the types, we also cannot perform any actions that are type specific, leaving us only one course of action.

      It's actually this feature that makes reason so compelling, especially for web and general purpose development. Through the usage of the bucklescript compiler, it provides a wonderful interoperability with the JavaScript ecosystem.

      <br /><br />To interop with JavaScript, we make use of the Foreign Function Interface (or FFI) from the bucklescript compiler. This allows you to write typed bindings to external JavaScript functions, and call them from inside Reason as if they were Reason functions.

      <br /><br />While the majority of the techniques discussed apply to reason, and to statically typed fp in general, I'll also discuss some features that are unique to the JavaScript interop process.

      While I've enjoyed frontend work for as long as React has been around, the core of a web application for me has always been the backend. Mostly because the backend is usually connected directly to the "source of truth" for the application, the persistance layer.

      <br /><br />Because of this, it's very important to me that the backend behave in a way that is both correct and predictable. But they so seldomly do.

      This code is an example of a standard part of every backend javascript project I've worked on. It's also an example of a dangerous pattern that's been lurking in every corner. Can you spot it? I see errors like this at least once a week. Unfortunately, there isn't an easy way to lint for these problems without writing lint-rules that are specific to controllers.

      <br /><br />The lurking problem is if the body doesn't contain either sendOne or sendTwo or itself is null. In that case, we don't respond to the client, timing out and not returning any useful information. A house built on foundations of straw rather than stone. So how could we begin solving this?

    <aside class="content">
      Our first approach should take care to enforce that the controller responds to the client. We want to insist that for all logic branches inside a controller, we definitely call either respond or handle error.

      <br /><br />To put this another way, a function that may or may NOT call res.send() has too much freedom. We want our controller functions to have a more restrictive type, one that does not allow it NOT to call res.send(). Only then will our compiler be able to spot these bugs for us.

      <br /><br />To do this, we have to write the operations such that they return a meaningful value, and so that the controller itself returns a value. This is where the type system of Reason shines bright.

      <br /><br />Working with the Reason ffi for express is a treat (in many ways much nicer than working with express directly).

      This is an overview of the binding for the express-js library. We're going to take a look at some tricks for writing a well-typed binding to the express library, using that to build a strong foundation for our app. We define a type done_ that we are going to use to indicate a function that should end the middleware traversal.

      <br /><br />We also introduce a new unit of abstraction, the module. The module is just about the best thing about the Reason type system. It's a beautiful way to encapsulate types, data and functionality and expose a public interface to any consumers while hiding private implementation details.

    <aside class="content">
      Here we see our first module implementations: the Request and Response modules. We define these modules as having an internal type t, a convention in the Reason world to denote a "main"-type inside the module.

      <br /><br />We have a very lean Request module for this example since we don't do very much with it. The Reponse module also has an internal type t, and contains a binding to an external function. This is the FFI provided by Reason and by the bucklescript tojs compiler.

      <br ><br />We define a method sendHTML to bind to the response object's send method to send an html string to the client. We indicate that this function will "end" the request-response cycle by having it "return" done_. This function will call the named function on the first value passed to it, denoted by the [@@bs.send] tag.

      <br /><br />We also create a lean Next module for the final parameter of the controller. This "next" parameter may be omitted in the underlying JS code, so we encapsulate it in a structure (JS.Nullable.t) that allows it to be null. In general, values cannot be null in Reason, unless you explicitly allow them to be. This allows the compiler to make sure you don't forget to handle the null case.

      <br /><br />The use of either of these methods used inside a controller should signal that the controller finishes it's request response cycle at that point.

    <aside class="content">
      We're now ready to write the types for our middleware module. We create a type t to store the type of a middleware in our system. We define a middleware as taking a Request.t object, a Response.t object, a Next.t function and returning a done_ type.

    <br /><br />WHY? Because the only way for our middleware function to be able to return a done_ value, is by calling sendHTML or Next.t and grab their return value. If there is a branch where the programmer forgets to call sendHTML or Next.t and grab the done_ value, that branch will not be able to return a done_ value at all, and the compiler will find the bug at compile time, instead of having the app malfunction at runtime!

      <br /><br />This way, regardless of what we do inside the middleware function, we know at compile time that we definitely respond to the user correctly.

    <aside class="content">
      Now we can write a controller. We define a function, f that accepts req, res and next, and performs some logic.

      <br /><br />We're also introduced to a new language feature, the switch keyword. this performs pattern matching, a compile-time feature similar to an "if", that allows you to define a mapping between a variable type and the code branch to execute. in practice, it is one of the more ergonomic ways to examine a value and perform different functions on the inner type depending on what it is, and is often used to destructure an algebraic data type to perform operations on the inner value;

      <br /><br />In this case, we use a theoretical function parseRequest that we can see returns an optional type. If the optional type is None, we say that an error occurred and use the next function to indicate an error occurred. Otherwise, we see that it can return Some containing either SendOne or SendTwo.

      <br /><br />If either of these occur we respond to the client with the html produced. We have a compilable program, and outside of the library bindings we have written 0 type annotations.

      <br /><br />Everything is inferrable!

    <aside class="content">
      Even better! When we make a mistake, our friendly compiler alerts us to what's missing. In this case, our pattern match reminds up we've forgotten to handle SendTwo and None, resulting in an incomplete pattern match.

      <br /><br />Not only that, but by using explicit nullable aka. "option" types explicit nullables, we avoid the billion dollar mistake of allowing null into our program. By pushing null conditions into our type system and handling them as values, such as None and Some, we can be sure at compile time that we don't have any surprises lurking as dynamic values. We never have to remember a null check, or hear about ".foo is not a method on undefined" or any of that terribly behaviour.

      Let's start with the canonical hello world program. We create a Greeting component that takes a string named message and render it inside a span.

      <br /><br />We ensure this using a ReactJS concept called prop-types. From at least as far back as 0.3 (2013) ReactJS has included the concept of prop-types. prop-types are a runtime type inspection of the values passed as arguments to a ReactJS component. This is the mechanism that pure-js ReactJS users lean on to validate the types of props being passed to components.

      The trouble with prop-types, as with all dynamic, runtime "type" solutions, is that they can only tell you about code paths you run.

      In Reason, ReactJS components are strongly typed at compile time, conferring all the benefits outlined before. A reason-react component is a module with a method make, that "extends" the returned template component from the ReasonReact library, in this case a stateless component. We provide the render method, and take the defaults from the template.

      <br /><br />We can see we use labeled args in our make function. We imply usage of a prop message, which the compiler will infer as of type string thanks to the usage of stringToElement in the body.

      <br /><br />reason-react doesn't have as loose a definition of what can be passed as children. Anything other than a ReactJS element will fail to compile, requiring us to first convert the variable to an element using the provided helper.

      Unlike some frontend state management tools, reason-react allows you to compartmentalise your state at the level that makes sense for you.

      <br /><br />It does so by a concept called a "reducer component". This component allows you to define a state type, and hold an instance of it. By passing callbacks that mutate this state, we trigger render changes in the component and all of its children.

      <br /><br />But that's way too big an example to swallow in one bite. Let's break it up.

      The first we override is the initialState function. This function is called when the component is first created, and intializes the state for the component. In this case, we initialise a Reason object to hold our clicks and restarts variables. This is the object we are going to change when a user interacts with this component.

      We then define a reducer. A reducer is a function of action and state that returns updated state. This is a property on the component that we invoke when we want to change the stored state to a new value.

      <br /><br />This reducer accepts messages we restrict to the action type we defined above. Inside this method, we pattern match on the action invoked and return an updated state as a result.

      We use the reduce method provided by reason-react to the render function to call the provided callback and pass the result to the reducer along with the current state. The callback passed to reduce returns the action to call, along with any data to use in the state update. Finally we create some buttons inside our component render that bind event handlers to their onclick events.

      <br /><br />Because this is bound to a component, we can easily encapsulate the state of a sub-tree of our ui without it being part of some massive global store or requiring every leaf to implement a store accessor.

      I actually have my wife to blame for this slide. She taught me the word "verlep" a few years ago, and it's such a fun word to say. It means limp or wilted, which is exactly how I feel about validation functions/frameworks in JavaScript.

      <br /><br />One of the problems I'm tackling at work at the moment is the data validation between the controller layer and the services layer in a web application. Once a request has been routed to a handler, and been authenticated and authorized, it's useful to have a dedicated layer responsible for validating that the data is correct and obeys the business rules required.

      <br /><br />However, by the nature of the language these validations often couple type validation with data validation, as well as providing no real safety to ensure that the process of validation has taken place.

    <aside class="content">
      In an untyped language, validating is pretty straightforward. We apply some functions to the data and return true if valid, or some errors if not. We can then pass the person to be saved. Most languages will hold a boolean on the model called valid or validated, and have some model code that calls a bunch of validators, setting this to true if they all pass.

      <br /><br /> This tightly couples the validation and save processes though, making it harder to safely separate the two processes. Either the boolean must be private, in which case the only way to set it and make the model safe to save is through the model validators, or it must be public, in which case anything can set it.

    <aside class="content">
      In this case, the type t is polymorphic, but it's polymorphism has no effect on the type constructued, which is always string. We can see the assignment of two variables here, one constrainted to t int, one to t float. However, the int and the float have no bearing on the types actually bound to the variables, both string. Thus the ^ operator which acts as a concatenaction operation on two string will join them together, will print foobar.

      <br /><br />This seems like a really wacky, esoteric technique, but it's actually a very powerful way to assert behaviour about your system at compile time that can help protect your system. To get that benefit, we couple it with a feature we saw earlier, opaque types. Let's discuss a validation approach that can guarantee us that save is never called with invalid, or not yet validated data.

      Introducing one of the more popular operators in Reason, the pipe (|>) operator. |> will take the result of the previous expression and insert it in the tail position of the next expression, allowing you to pipe data from function to function, similar to pipe in a shell.

      <br /><br />This is the API we'd like to be able to rely on. If we try save a person without first calling validate on them, it should fail. But most importantly, it should fail at compile time. It must be impossible to write a function where we even try to save an unvalidated object.

      First we declare a module where we define three opaque types, valid, invalid and t 'a.

      Next we see the only method that will convert an invalid type to a valid type. The validate function.

      Finally, we have our action method. Here we apply the save method to the validated data, persisting it in our database. We can see that this method can only be applied to valid structures.

      <br /><br />Since the only way to create a valid structure is through the validate method, we can be sure that any data passed to this method has been through our validate call. We can assert at compile time that we don't try to save any invalid data.

      The coolest thing about this trick becomes clear when we look at the implementation of the validator. The type t that we use to constrict our person to invalid/valid states doesn't actually reference these states directly.

      <br /><br />We use an ordinary constructor to build a person, with no direct reference to the phantom type. The make and validate functions are interesting here as well. We don't explicitly cast our invalid type to a valid one in any obvious way. Make constructs a person using the constructor, and validate takes that person and returns a new one if the validate passes.

      <br /><br />This should signal something about our friendly ghosts - they don't exist at runtime. This means there's no wrap-unwrap penalty for using them. We get compile time certainty that we've called validate first, and pay no extra penalty for being safe.

      Reason's premier code organisation and reuse abstraction has to be the module. Modules provide scope to both types and values, namespacing access to these things as well as providing ways to define interfaces and public/private access.

      <br /><br />Modules are the most widely used Reason feature, for kind of a cheating reason. By definition, every single file in Reason is automatically wrapped up in a module that is named by the file name. That means that all values and types are scoped to the file they are defined in, and must be manually imported / aliased in other files in order to be used.

      The first definition in this snippet defines a module type. This type will define the interface for any module that implements it. In this case we require that anything that implements AddInterface must at least have some type t, which is kept abstract, and a function add that takes two ts and returns a t.

      <br /><br />We then come to our two implementations, IntImpl and FloatImpl. We can see that the inner implementation of the interface can supply a t that is concrete or abstract. In these cases it is concrete, but if it was a type that contained constructors then we wouldn't be able to access them outside of the module since t is abstract, allowing for privacy.

      One of the amazing things about Reason's modules is that they are first class citizens of the language. This means that they can be used as values, passed to functions, the whole shebang. To visualise this, we're going to define a function, mappendList, that takes an arbitrary Monoid and list of values, and combines them using the Monoid's mappend method.

      <br /><br /> We define an incomplete Monoid interface as having an abstract type, t for the type the Monoid is implemented for. It has a value, mempty, that indicates the base value for combination and a method mappend that combines values of this type t.

      <br /><br />We then define mappendList to be generic for some type a, to take a module that implements Monoid, and constrain it to reference it's internal type t as being of type a, and some list l that contains values of type a.

      <br /><br />We need to use this generic type to allow us to sidestep the fact that t is abstract inside Monoid and so cannot be easily referenced when converting Monoid to a first class module. This was we can set an equality between Monoid.t and list of a without leaking implementation details.

    <aside class="content">
      Then, defining implementations for IntAdd and IntMult gives us some Monoid modules we can use. Now that we've defined our function, we can apply different modules that implement Monoid to mappendList and get back different results, all without changing the behaviour of the function.

      <br /><br />This is the power of combining generics with first class modules. We should also notice that IntMult is a superset of Monoid, and that Reason's type system allows us to supply modules that "at least" implement the required interface.

    <aside class="content">
      Unlike the canonical functor of fmap and category theory fame, in Reason a functor is a method of abstracting over a module. It allows us to define generic module behaviour parametrised over the definition of a module.

      <br /><br />Effectively, we can define the generic implementation of a module, and then make it concrete by applying an input module.

      We define an Input module type and an Output module type. Then we define a Functor named Make that takes modules of type Input and returns modules of type Output. These names are completely arbitrary, as is the type assignment in the definition of Make.

      <br /><br />Module Functors are a useful pattern when we want to generate code from a base definition. By using the input definition, we can write a type for Output that is constructed from all of the information present in Input. That is, we can write an implementation that is a superset of Input, and then generate that code by applying a module of type Input to Make. This is a similar idea to Haskell Type-Classes, c++ templates and a number of other generic structures.

      So in order to define the Mappable instance for a type, we need to define a module that obeys the Mappable.Input module type. By supplying a module that implements that interface to the Make Functor, we are returned a module that implements the Mappable.Output module with all the additional methods defined there.

      <br /><br />In this case, we generate the (<$>) function using the fmap function from the input. We could also define a host of other functions that only need access to the type t and the function fmap to be implemented. By doing that, we separate out the definition of the Output code from the Input, allowing us to generate the required functions as needed.

    <aside class="content">
      The drawback of the abstraction model in Reason is that it doesn't support ad-hoc polymorphism, nor higher kinded types. That does mean that there are a number of abstractions that languages like Haskell can implement that don't have direct implementations in Reason. There is an excellent spec being worked on to add a feature named <a href="http://www.lpw25.net/ml2014.pdf">modular implicits</a>, which will add many of the same advantages as type-classes and ad-hoc polymorphism to the language.

      But the hardest part is that we can only test what we remember to test. So we find ourselves at the mercy of our memories, or our tooling, or our available time. Tests fall by the wayside when refactoring, when re-writing, when re-iterating.

      <br /><br />Types give you many of the safeties of the common unit test assertions, with no runtime cost. Modern compilers (like bucklescript) are orders of magnitude faster than most test frameworks, and provide a more automatic kind of safety.
